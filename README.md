# PyCAD

Simple CAD designed using pygame. It is still a work in progress project, so if you want to contribute fork this repository, make the changes into the forked repository and push a new Merge Request to 'main' branch. Open an issue in case of big MRs.

# To use it
```
clone the repository
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
$ python3.10 -m venv venv
$ source venv/bin/activate
$ python main.py
```

# Usage
Draw imgages. It saves the content to file `data.pickle` when the application is closed and reloads it next time the application is opened.
